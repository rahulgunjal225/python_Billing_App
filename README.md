# python_Billing_App
The goal of this project is to develop a GUI-based billing application for a retail store using Python and Tkinter. It helps shopkeepers easily manage customer orders, calculate item-wise and category-wise totals, apply taxes, and generate a final bill that can be saved and retrieved later.
